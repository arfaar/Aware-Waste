        <h3 class="about-us-title"> Sustainable Practices for Disposal of E-waste</h3>
        <p class="about-us-description">
            Recycling electronics waste, or ‚Äúe-waste,‚Äù can help conserve our natural resources and avoid creating more greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
            E-waste is the fastest-growing solid-waste stream in the world, but less than 25% of all electronic waste is recycled in the United States;
            the rest is incinerated or goes to landfills. Electronics are made up of valuable materials, such as metals, glass, and plastics‚Äîall of 
            which take energy to mine and manufacture. They can also contain materials that are harmful to the environment, like mercury and beryllium. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="about-us-headings"> Repair your Devices </h4>
        <p class="about-us-description"> 
            Before buying a replacement for your electronics, consider repairing them to extend their lifespans and 
            produce less e-waste. Ifixit.org defends the right to repair electronics, as companies may use copyright 
            laws in order to ensure that people don‚Äôt use an unauthorized repairer, and teaches people how to repair 
            their own devices.  
        </p>
        <h4 class="about-us-headings"> Extend the Lifespan </h4>
        <p class="about-us-description"> 
            Companies often incentivize buying a newer model of a gadget by producing software upgrades that can only be 
            downloaded on the newer models of smartphones and computers, but try to use your electronics for as long as 
            possible in order to reduce the amount of e-waste that you create.
        </p>
        <h4 class="about-us-headings"> Resell </h4>
        <p class="about-us-description"> 
            Consider reselling your device through websites such as Poshmark or eBay, so its lifespan can be extended.
            These products will either be reused by someone else or their parts will be recycled. You can find out how
             to delete all your personal information from your devices. You‚Äôll need to do this before reselling the 
             device.
        </p> 
        <h4 class="about-us-headings"> Recycle </h4>
        <p class="about-us-description"> 
            If you cannot continue to use your electronics or resell them, then ensure that you are recycling them responsibly.
            Create creative DIY's or give us a call for collection of your devices to the E-waste centers.
