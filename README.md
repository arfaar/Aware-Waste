## AWARE WASTE - where we don’t just recycle bottles, we declutter bytes! 💻
The project deals with a creation of website especially multipage website along the theme of E- waste. 
The main aim of the website is to educate and create awareness about E-waste for the public. 
The development of the website includes various phases and many factors has to be properly considered for its success. 
This section is the design document that notes down all the crucial factors for designing of the website. 
(This was designed and developed for one of my university module 😊)

## 🔗 Initial Build 
Before starting with the creation of the website, I first created a design document that addressed the critical factors and design elements.
The initiation of the process was done by stating the project objectives and the target audiences of the website. 
Based on these, the requirements of the projects were listed out. Two types of requirements were considered, client and user. 
Considering both sides of the requirements let to the generation of most important requirements that should be included within the website.

## 🤼 Users Vs Clients 
There is a difference in perception of what the website should offer among the user and the client. 
Therefore, analyzing and finding out these requirements will make the website satisfy both of them. 
Moving on, next the design principles were generalized. This is where, core principles and design consistency was taken into account. 
As the website will be multi-page, there should be consistency among the elements throughout. 
It is found that design consistency plays an important role in enhancing the user experience. 
Therefore, if I did not consider these during the design process, the major look and feel of the website would have been affected.
The website pages need to be structured, which is why the next step was to outline the layout of the website.
I clearly stated the various pages and their description with the help of site map. 

## 📋 Pre Build 
Finally, wireframes were sketched out and included within the design document. I have created two versions of wireframes.
Creating the wireframes beforehand has enabled me to visualize the website and define the design consistencies to be used. 
In fact, I was able to notice that I missed the footer component of the website totally in the first version. 
The entire process of design documenting has allowed me to set clear design principles in place and guarantee that the requirements of both the users and clients from the perspective of design in included.

## 👩🏻‍💻 Developing Attack 
Moving on, the development process was a little tedious compared to design process.
I chose to code the entire website following the design document.
The process was time-consuming but I was able to develop the website properly.
A lot of features were incorporated. One such feature was responsiveness.
I chose to make my website responsive in order to ensure that it is able to successfully adjust to the screen size of any device or browser.
I also implemented JavaScript, to add in few interactive elements to enhance the User Experience of the website. 

## 🥺 Harsh Truth 
The major technical difficulty that I faced was the lack of experience with the programming language.
It is my first time working with CSS and JavaScript, and it was very new to me at the starting. 
However, I was accustomed to HTML and by following few tutorials, I was able to grasp the basic knowledge of web development. 
Lastly, I was able to meet the client and user requirements majorly, as they were the key priorities to be incorporated within the website. 

I will stop here for your better eyesight!
